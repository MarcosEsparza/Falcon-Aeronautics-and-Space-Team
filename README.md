# Falcon-Aeronautics-and-Space-Team
This repository contains the design files, simulations, CAD models, and documentation for the Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team (FAST) entry in the 2026 Spaceport America Cup, 10k COTS category. It serves as the central location for all design, analysis, and reporting work.

Repository Structure:
cad/ – SolidWorks parts, assemblies, and STEP exports
docs/ – DTEG notes, meeting summaries, internal documentation
simulations/ – OpenRocket files, MATLAB scripts (flutter, stability, performance)
paper/ – Technical paper outline, figures, references

Team Guidelines:
-Use clear commit messages and avoid overwriting others’ work.
-Keep files organized in the correct folders.
-Document major design or analysis changes with short notes.
-Upload stable CAD versions only; export STEP files after major updates.
-Version or date OpenRocket and MATLAB files when updating.

Project Summary:
FAST is developing a 10,000-ft COTS rocket featuring an aluminum fin can, fiberglass airframe, dual-deploy recovery, MATLAB-based aero analysis, and detailed simulation and mass-tracking work. This repository supports consistent team collaboration and smooth technical report development.
