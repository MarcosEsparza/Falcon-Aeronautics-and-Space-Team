# FAST – Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team

This repository contains the design files, simulations, CAD models, and documentation for the Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team entry in the 2026 Spaceport America Cup (10k COTS). It serves as the central location for all design, analysis, and reporting work.

## Repository Structure
- cad/ – SolidWorks or Fusion parts, assemblies, and STEP exports
- docs/ – DTEG rule notes, meeting summaries, internal documentation
- simulations/ – OpenRocket files and MATLAB scripts (flutter, stability, performance)
- paper/ – Technical paper outline, figures, references

## Team Guidelines
- Use clear commit messages and avoid overwriting others’ files.
- Keep files organized in the correct folders.
- Document major design or analysis changes with short notes.
- Upload stable CAD versions only; export STEP files after major updates.
- Version or date OpenRocket and MATLAB files when updating.

## Project Summary
The team is developing a 10,000-ft COTS rocket featuring an aluminum fin can, fiberglass airframe, dual-deploy recovery, MATLAB-based aero analysis, and detailed simulation and mass-tracking work. This repository supports consistent team collaboration and smooth technical report development.
