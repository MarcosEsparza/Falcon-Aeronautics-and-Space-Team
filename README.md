# Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team

This repository contains the design files, simulations, CAD models, and technical documentation for the Falcon Aeronautics & Space Team entry in the 2026 Spaceport America and Lone Star Cup. It serves as the central location for all design, analysis, testing, and reporting work.

## Repository Structure
- cad/ – SolidWorks/Fusion parts, assemblies, and STEP exports
- docs/ – DTEG rule notes and internal technical documentation
- simulations/ – OpenRocket files and MATLAB scripts (flutter, stability, performance)
- paper/ – Technical paper outline, figures, references
- requirements/ – Mission objectives, design constraints, and DTEG compliance tracking
- testing/ – Ejection tests, avionics checks, recovery tests, mass properties
- flight_data/ – Actual launch data, altimeter logs, and OR comparison results
- avionics/ – Wiring diagrams, bay layout, firmware settings, and config files

## Team Guidelines
- Use clear commit messages and avoid overwriting others’ files.
- Keep files organized in their correct folders.
- Document major design or analysis changes with short notes.
- Upload stable CAD versions only; export STEP files after major updates.
- Version or date OpenRocket and MATLAB files when updating.
- Store all test data in testing/ and all flight data in flight_data/ for traceability.
